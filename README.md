# AEON - Goal

This discord bot is just a fun little side project for a personal discord server, 
going in we have some plans but not much set in stone so it could turn into anything really

# AEON - Features

NOTHING!

# AEON - Setup
You can download the files as is and run assuming node.js (10.15.3) is installed

You can check your version with ``` node -v```

You will also need to provide your own ```auth.json``` file, this is where your bot's key is stored.
Just create a file named ```auth.json``` and enter the following

```
{
   "token": "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}
```

add the ```auth.json``` file to the root.

 
to run the bot, just use

```
node bot.js
```

in the project root. 

The bot is now running on your machine from the terminal you ran the command from. 
We plan on moving ours to a dedicated raspberry pi eventually
